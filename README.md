My final project for CS50 is a website called "My Word Database" which is to help users identify the most common words that he or she sees.

## Abstract
 
While studying Japanese I came to a point I needed to build my vocabulary but was unsure of how to. Based on recommendations on reddit the best way is to take note of common words that you often see or hear. I used anki and added the most common words that I observed on online and had an improvement on both my reading and vocabulary. However I wanted to streamline the process of knowing what are this words that I commonlly see but do not know.


I created this website with the intention to help users identify the words the see the most by having the user inputting paragraphs or words into it and by bubble search brings the most common words up to the top of the table.
