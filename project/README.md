Hello, my name is Joshua and I am from Singapore.

This website, My word databse, is created to help users identify the most common words they see on the internet.

I got this idea when I was trying to improve my vocabulary while learning a foreign langauage.

The first page, "Table" will show (in order) the most common words the user has seen and the number of times seen.

The second page, "Update" allows the user to input text that are of interest to them to update the table list.

After submitting, the user is taken to a 'filter' page that will allow the users to choose the words that he or she wants to learn.

Upon submission the user if taken back to the users table.

The last page, "Remove" allows the user to remove words that he or she feels confident of knowing,
After removal the user can proceed to practise other words that he or she commonly sees.

My name is Joshua and this was CS50
